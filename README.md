"# Pan-TiltFaceDetectionCamera" 

- This is a python project for computer vision to detect the face of the user and controlling the movement of the camera based on user's face position
- The project used 2 microcontroller such as raspberry pi for face detection algorithm and arduino for controlling the pan & tilt movement of the servo motor
- The project uses raspberry pi to detect the face using opencv library and send signal to Arduino to update the position of the servo
